practiceGit w Mr. Lam

Lets write a story.

This a story about cats!!!!!!!!

And This is a story about how Mrs. Uniat tried to have a mini hackathon and have surprise guest speakers.

Tuong was able to get some people to learn a bit about GUI, but not as many people were interested in elearning about GIT. So James did not run his session.

Then everyone got started, and I did not let on that Ly was coming in as the guest.
